Usage of the deprecation script is pretty self explanatory
based on the usage message printed by the python scripts.
The recommended way is to use the python scripts one by one manually,
but you can also use the deprecateFunctions.bash script to run them together

But it is important to note the limitations of these two scripts combined.

1. Multiple occurences of a word on a line.
If a line has multiple instances of a function on a single line that has to be replaced, all instances will be replaced
This may not be the correct behavior in some cases.

2. Functions spanning across multiple lines
Since a function call may span multiple lines, the chapel compiler will report the error/warning to be on the first line.
But the actual offending call may be on the subsequent lines which requires manual replacement.

3. Aggressive matching
Running the script multiple times without well defined word boundaries may cause erronious replacements.
Be mindful of what words you pass into the script as replacements
