The following now creates an int(64) range, where a uint(16) range is desired:
  const chars = eol..<maxChars;

Currently getting:
  revcomp8.chpl:37: error: unresolved call 'join(int(64), int(64))'
  revcomp8.chpl:174: note: this candidate did not match: join(i: uint(16), j)
  revcomp8.chpl:37: note: because actual argument #1 with type 'int(64)'
  revcomp8.chpl:174: note: is passed to formal 'i: uint(16)'

A solution is to change to:
  const chars = eol..<maxChars:eol.type;
