bug: readBinary() corrupting input

This test reads in an input file using readBinary() and writes it out
using writeBinary() to make sure data is preserved.  It shows that
when using readBinary() for the idiom used here, we end up corrupting
the input data right around line 1075.

When using old-style binary channels and a normal read() call with the
same pattern, we did not see this issue.  It also goes away if we use
'-sIOSkipBufferingForLargeOps=true'.  I've also verified that the
issue is in the read, not the write by using the old read approach and
the new writeBinary().
