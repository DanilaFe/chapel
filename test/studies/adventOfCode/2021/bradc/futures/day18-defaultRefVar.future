feature request/error message: 'ref' arguments with defaults

It seems as though we should support 'ref' arguments that have default
intents, which can be useful in recursive settings.  Otherwise, either
the callee must pass in a variable they may not care about, or the
routine must create a bootstrapping overload of itself that doesn't
take the additional arg.
