bug: c_ptr representing c_array in baseline

At the time of this .future's creation, this test fails under --baseline due to
a bug in codegen. The field-accessor for 'foo' is not inlined, and so its body
includes a GET_MEMBER call that is meant to fetch a reference to the 'foo'
field. Currently an LLVM-specific branch recognizes this exact case and
replaces the GEN_PTR with a GEN_VAL, leading to a failure later when attempting
to generate an ADDR_OF.

Using the C backend results in an "attempt to dereference nil" failure at
execution time.
