─── error in test/errors/laterVar.chpl:1 [UseOfLaterVariable] ───
  Statement references a variable before it is defined.
  In the following statement:
      |
    1 | var x = y;
      |
  there is a reference to a variable defined later:
      |
    2 | var y = 1;
      |
  Chapel doesn't allow references to variables before they are defined.
