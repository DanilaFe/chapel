─── error in test/errors/tupleDecls.chpl:1 [TupleDeclNotTuple] ───
  Attempt to use tuple declaration to split a value of non-tuple type 'type UnknownType'.
  In the following tuple declaration:
      |
    1 | var (x,y) = notKnown;
      |
  the value being assigned has type 'type UnknownType', while it is expected to be a 2-element tuple.

─── error in test/errors/tupleDecls.chpl:3 [TupleDeclNotTuple] ───
  Attempt to use tuple declaration to split a value of non-tuple type 'int(64)'.
  In the following tuple declaration:
      |
    3 | var (u,v) = z;
      |
  the value being assigned has type 'int(64)', while it is expected to be a 2-element tuple.

─── error in test/errors/tupleDecls.chpl:4 [TupleDeclMismatchedElems] ───
  Tuple size mismatch in split tuple declaration.
      |
    4 | var (a,b,c) = (1,2);
      |
  The left-hand side of the declaration expects a tuple with 3 elements, but the right-hand side, which is a tuple '(int(64), int(64))', has 2 elements.
