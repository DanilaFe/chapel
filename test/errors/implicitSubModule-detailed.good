─── warning in implicitSubModule.chpl:4 [ImplicitFileModule] ───
  An implicit module named 'implicitSubModule' is being introduced to contain this file-scope code.
  The following is the first file-scope statement:
      |
    4 | use List;
      |
  The implicit module 'implicitSubModule' is being created because the above code is outside of any module declarations (e.g., 'module M').
  Note that all of the file's contents will be placed into the new 'implicitSubModule' module.
