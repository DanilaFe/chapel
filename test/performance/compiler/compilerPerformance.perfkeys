# Note: Do _not_ change this file just to make the test 'passCheck' stop
# failing. That test serves as a sentinel to alert you that compiler
# performance is broken. Simply fixing that test does _not_ fix compiler
# performance testing.
#
# For now you can just ping Elliot when a pass changes, he's happy to fix
# compiler performance testing. Passes don't change often so this shouldn't be
# a big deal, but if it becomes an issue we can try to come up with a better
# solution. See passCheck.prediff for more details.
