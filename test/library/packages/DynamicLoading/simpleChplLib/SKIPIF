# Currently, CHPL_COMM!=none causes us to create client-server style
# libraries; This directory just wants single-node libraries, so
# doesn't support testing on CHPL_COMM!=none at present.  Note that if
# the dynamic library is built for a single locale, it can correctly
# be invoked from multiple locales, but that we don't have a way in
# our testing system to do that since the runtime will typically only
# be built for one config or the other.
