This directory is locking down that we currently have a memory leak for
ConcurrentMap.  These tests symlink to equivalent correctness tests and can be
removed once this leak is fixed.

We only symlink to the a subset of these tests where the
allocations/deallocations are deterministic (this should be sufficient for
memory tracking purposes).
