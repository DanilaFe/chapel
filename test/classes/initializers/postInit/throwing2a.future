feature request: throwing initializers post-'init this' without helpers

It seems we can throw in initializers if we put the throwing behavior
into a helper function (see 'throwing2.chpl') but not if we put it
directly?  (this test).  If that's intentional, it seems like the error
message could be tightened up since it's a bit overly broad currently.
