feature request: fully defaulted generic types should stringify with '(?)'

THis demonstrates surprising behavior to me in that given 'R', a
fully-defaulted generic record, converting 'R(?)' to a string results
in 'R(true)' rather than 'R(?)'.

Note that in the .good file, I don't have a strong feeling as to how
the first 6 lines print, but just wanted to lock in how things worked
today.  I did think some of the asymmetries in the current
implementation were interesting.
