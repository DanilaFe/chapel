bug: Incorrect resolution within param bool loop, but not manual rewrite

The first, manually unrolled version should be identical to the
second, param loop version, yet we get strange resolution errors from
the loop form.

Interestingly, if rewriting the param bool loop as an int bool loop,
things work (see dispatchWithinIntParamLoop.chpl)
