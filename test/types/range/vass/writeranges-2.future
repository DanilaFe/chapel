feature request: distinguish ambiguous and unambiguous range alignments when printing

When printing a range, I'd like to see an indication that its
alignment is ambiguous, when that is the case. An ambiguous alignment
could be printed as '?' (as in .good) or a legal Chapel expression
could be provided, e.g.

   (.. by 2)(1..5) printed for the range 1..5 by 2 align ?

Right now 1..5 by 2 and 1..5 by 2 align ? print out the same,
which is unsatisfactory.

2023-07 note: currently an ambiguously-aligned range is not allowed
as the first argument of slicing; also, slicing always produces
an aligned range. Therefore the following expressions are illegal
and even switching the order of the arguments will not produce
unaligned ranges. So I replaced them with single unaligned ranges:

    (1.. by -2)(0..5)
    (1.. by -2)(1..5)
    (1.. by -2)(2..5)
    (.. by 2)(1..5)
    (.. by -2)(1..5)
    (.. by -2)(1..5 by -3)

These changes also reduce the appeal of this feature, as we no longer
have situations where two ranges print the same and one is aligned
and the other one is not.
