bug: Slicing with a range that has its bounds completely outside the array should halt

Currently since bounds check returns true, the slice is created and then the slice
is sliced with the range. 
Since the slice is an empty range and all ranges "contain" the empty range,
bounds check returns true vaccuosly. This should be false instead.
Similarly, the slice should not be created and the slice operation should halt.
