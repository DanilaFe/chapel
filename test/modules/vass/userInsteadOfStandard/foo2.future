bug: incorrect line number reported in a warning

The compiler warns about a missing '(?)' in modules/standard/ChapelIO.chpl
whereas it should about ./ChapelIO.chpl
// in serializeDefaultImpl() in both cases

Perhaps serializeDefaultImpl() in modules/standard/ChapelIO.chpl
should indeed be updated, however in the absense of a custom ChapelIO.chpl
such warning is currently not generated.
