# This test checks that things run fine if you have a gpuizable loop who's
# upper bound exceeds the bounds of a 32-bit signed integer. As of the writing
# of this comment, it can run fine on cpu but it takes an awfully long time.  I
# think the cost of waiting for it to complete outweighs the marginal benefit
# of having it covered by nightly-testing and it seems unlikely that it would
# show up as an issue in cpu-as-device mode and not elsewhere so I'm going to
# skipif it for nightly testing purposes.  Hopefuly, you're not looking at this
# .skipif file because I was just proven wrong :-).
