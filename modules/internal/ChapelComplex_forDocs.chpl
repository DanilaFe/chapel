// This is a dummy chapel that is used to anchor some internal definitions
// during the last day before Doc Freeze for 1.12.  This file is processed
// for docs in modules/Makefile but is not part of the Chapel Module code
// base.
//
// One reason to create this file is that the Chapel compiler, and hence
// chpldoc, fails if it is asked to compile ChapelBase directly.  It is
// speculated that this is because ChapelBase auto-magically included as
// anchor module by the compiler.

Like the integral and real types, the complex types can be parameterized
by the number of bits used to represent them. A complex number is
composed of two real numbers so the number of bits used to represent a
complex is twice the number of bits used to represent the real numbers.
The default complex type, ``complex``, is 128 bits; it consists of two
64-bit real numbers. The complex types that are supported are
machine-dependent, but usually include ``complex(64)`` and
``complex(128)``.

The real and imaginary components can be accessed via the methods ``re``
and ``im``. The type of these components is a ``real``. The standard :mod:`Math`
module provides some functions on complex types. See the :mod:`Math`
module documentation.

   *Example*.

   Given a complex number ``c`` with the value ``3.14+2.72i``, the
   expressions ``c.re`` and ``c.im`` refer to ``3.14`` and ``2.72``
   respectively.
