Qthreads README for Chapel
==========================

This copy of Qthreads 1.22 is being released with Chapel for
convenience and was obtained from:

  https://github.com/sandialabs/qthreads

Any Chapel issues that seem to be related to Qthreads should be directed
to the Chapel team at https://chapel-lang.org/bugs.html.


Upgrading versions
============================

The directory $CHPL_HOME/third-party/qthread/qthread-src contains
a copy of the Qthreads repository. Version updates should be done
as follows, assuming the CWD is $CHPL_HOME/third-party/qthread/:

1. download the latest qthread version: e.g. `wget https://github.com/sandialabs/qthreads/archive/refs/tags/1.22.tar.gz -O qthread-src.tar.gz`
2. `git rm -r qthread-src`
3. `tar xf qthread-src.tar.gz`
4. `git add --force qthread-src` (--force to ignore our .gitignore)
5. update the version number mentioned above
6. test
7. commit, PR, merge, etc
