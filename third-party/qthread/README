Chapel modifications to Qthreads
================================

The modifications that we have made to the official Qthreads release are
as follows:

* We force tasks being woken from sync vars to run on their original
  shepherd. This is to work around a task serialization bug that stems
  from us using schedulers that don't support work stealing (nemesis)
  or running with work stealing disabled (distrib w/ QT_STEAL_RATIO=0)

* Pulled in an upstream fix for resetting task spawn order
  https://github.com/sandialabs/qthreads/pull/136

* Pulled in an upstream fix for build errors on Alpine linux
  https://github.com/sandialabs/qthreads/pull/105

* Pulled in an upstream patch to get topology from an external function
  https://github.com/sandialabs/qthreads/pull/133

* Pulled in upstream patches to make configure time check of hwloc optional
  https://github.com/sandialabs/qthreads/pull/131
  https://github.com/sandialabs/qthreads/pull/132
