Upgrading libunwind versions
========================

The directory $CHPL_HOME/third-party/libunwind/libunwind-src/ contains the
un-tarballed libunwind package contents. Version updates should be done as
follows, assuming the CWD is $CHPL_HOME/third-party/libunwind/:

1. download and untar the latest libunwind 1.X version: e.g. libunwind-1.5.0
2. `rm -rf libunwind-src`
3. `mv libunwind-1.5.0 libunwind-src`
4. `git add --force libunwind-src` (--force to ignore our .gitignore)
5. update the version number mentioned above
6. make sure these instructions are up to date :)
7. commit, PR, merge, etc
