GASNet for Chapel release
=========================

This copy of GASNet-2025.8.0 is being released with Chapel for
convenience and was obtained from

  https://gasnet.lbl.gov/

Any Chapel issues that seem to be related to GASNet should be directed
to the Chapel team at https://chapel-lang.org/bugs.html.

Upgrading GASNet versions
=========================

The directory $CHPL_HOME/third-party/gasnet/gasnet-src/ contains the
un-tarballed GASNet package contents.  Version updates should be done as
follows, assuming the CWD is $CHPL_HOME/third-party/gasnet/:

1. Download the new package from https://bitbucket.org/berkeleylab/gasnet/downloads/GASNet-2025.8.0.tar.gz
2. un-tarball the new package version into the directory it specifies,
   for example GASNet-2025.8.0
3. git rm -r gasnet-src
4. mv GASNet-2025.8.0 gasnet-src
5. git add --force gasnet-src
   ('--force' is needed so that the 'git add' ignores our .gitignore)
6. commit
7. update the new sources by re-applying any needed patches (see above)
   and commit
8. PR, merge, etc.

Chapel modifications to GASNet
==============================

The modifications that we have made to the GASNet source are as follows:

* Add GASNET_NO_PSHM_WARNING flag to disable warning that occurs when
  co-locales are run without PSHM enabled.
