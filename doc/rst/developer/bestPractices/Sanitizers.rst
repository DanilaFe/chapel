Sanitizers
==========

Sanitizers are a compiler feature that support instrumenting programs to do
dynamic analysis to catch many classes of bugs at runtime.

AddressSanitizer (ASan) is a fast memory error detector. It consists of a
compiler instrumentation module and a run-time library. ASan is similar
to valgrind (:ref:`best-practices-valgrind`) in that it can help
identify memory errors. ASan is much faster than valgrind, but does
require recompilation. Note that only GCC and Clang support sanitizers.

How-to
------

To use AddressSanitizer with Chapel-generated executables only:

.. code-block:: bash

     export CHPL_TARGET_MEM=cstdlib
     export CHPL_TARGET_COMPILER=gnu # or CHPL_TARGET_COMPILER=clang
     export CHPL_SANITIZE_EXE=address
     export ASAN_OPTIONS="use_sigaltstack=0,detect_leaks=0"

     cd $CHPL_HOME
     make
     chpl <program.chpl>
     ./<program>

To use it with both the Chapel compiler and its generated executables:

.. code-block:: bash

     export CHPL_TARGET_MEM=cstdlib
     export CHPL_TARGET_COMPILER=gnu # or CHPL_TARGET_COMPILER=clang
     export CHPL_HOST_MEM=cstdlib
     export CHPL_SANITIZE=address
     export ASAN_OPTIONS="use_sigaltstack=0,detect_leaks=0"

     cd $CHPL_HOME
     make
     chpl <program.chpl>
     ./<program>

To get better stack traces when optimizations are enabled:

.. code-block:: bash

     export DEBUG=1


.. note::

     Non-chplenv environment variables aren't propagated by paratest. So,
     to turn off leak checking, it is necessary to either pass
     ``-env ASAN_OPTIONS="use_sigaltstack=0,detect_leaks=0"`` or to include
     ``export ASAN_OPTIONS="use_sigaltstack=0,detect_leaks=0"`` in .bashrc or
     the equivalent.

See :ref:`readme-sanitizers` for more information on using AddressSanitizer with
Chapel programs. That page also lists various limitations of AddressSanitizer
with Chapel programs, which also apply to the use of AddressSanitizer for
debugging the Chapel compiler itself.
