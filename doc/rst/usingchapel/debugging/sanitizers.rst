Sanitizers
==========

Sanitizers are a compiler feature that support instrumenting programs to do
dynamic analysis to catch many classes of bugs at runtime.

AddressSanitizer (ASan) is a fast memory error detector. It consists of a
compiler instrumentation module and a run-time library. ASan is similar to
valgrind in that it can help identify memory errors. ASan is much faster than
valgrind, but does require recompilation. Note that only GCC and Clang support
sanitizers.

Building the compiler
---------------------

The following chplenv variables are required to build the Chapel compiler with
sanitizers enabled:

.. code-block:: bash

   export CHPL_TARGET_MEM=cstdlib
   export CHPL_TARGET_COMPILER=gnu # or CHPL_TARGET_COMPILER=clang
   export CHPL_SANITIZE_EXE=address

Running the compiled program
----------------------------

After building a compiler configured like the above, you can build and run a
Chapel program with AddressSanitizer enabled by setting the following
environment variables:

.. code-block:: bash

   chpl <program.chpl>
   export ASAN_OPTIONS="use_sigaltstack=0,detect_leaks=0"
   ./<program>

Limitations
-----------

AddressSanitizer should be able to detect almost all memory errors for single
locale configurations using ``CHPL_COMM=none``. However, ASan cannot detect all
classes of memory errors in multilocale configurations and the extent of the
support depends on the ``CHPL_COMM`` setting. As a specific example some
configurations will not be able to detect invalid remote reads/writes since
ASan only knows about local memory. In the following program the invalid write
to the array may not be detected for configurations that use RDMA to perform
writes.

.. code-block:: chapel

   var A: [1..10] int;
   on Locales[numLocales-1] {
     A[11] = 11; // Out of bounds write
   }

This particular example would be caught by Chapel bounds checking, which are
enabled by default but disabled with ``--fast``. To get bounds checking and
optimizations you can use ``--fast --bounds-checks`` or ``--fast --checks``.

``CHPL_COMM=gasnet`` with ``CHPL_COMM_SUBSTRATE=udp`` should be able to detect
most memory errors since remote reads/writes are performed with active messages
instead of RDMA.

``CHPL_COMM=ugni`` without hugepages can detect some, but not all invalid
remote reads/writes, but comes with a large performance cost. Hugepages can be
unloaded with ``module unload $(module -t list 2>&1 | grep craype-hugepages)``


Configuration Limitations
-------------------------

The above options are needed because not all third-party libraries support
sanitizers. In particular:

- Sanitizer instrumentation is added by the C compiler, so LLVM
  compilations don't currently work
- Sanitizers hook into the system allocator, so using ``jemalloc`` is not
  supported
- By default the gcc address sanitizer will enable leak checking, but
  Chapel intentionally leaks some memory in the runtime, so we disable
  that tracking for now. See :ref:`readme-debugging` for more info about
  debugging memory leaks in Chapel.
- An upstream bug_ can result in false-positives for some gcc versions.
  ``use_sigaltstack=0`` works around this.

Other Sanitizers
----------------

Currently, only AddressSanitizer is regularly tested, but the options passed to
``CHPL_SANITIZE_EXE`` are passed directly to the backend compiler's
``-fsanitize=`` option, so other sanitizers can be enabled. For example, to use
C undefined behavior sanitizer and address sanitizer set
``CHPL_SANITIZE_EXE=undefined,memory``.

ThreadSanitizer (TSan)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

ThreadSanitizer is a tool for detecting race conditions in multithreaded
programs. To use it in with Chapel programs, set ``CHPL_SANITIZE_EXE=thread``.
Note instead of using ``ASAN_OPTIONS``, you should set ``TSAN_OPTIONS`` to
configure TSan.
