.. _what-is-gasnet:

What is GASNet?
+++++++++++++++

GASNet is a one-sided communication and active message library being
developed by Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory and UC Berkeley.  For
details, refer to the `GASNet website <https://gasnet.lbl.gov/>`_.

.. _set-comm-conduit:

Setting CHPL_COMM_SUBSTRATE
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++

Users can set ``CHPL_COMM_SUBSTRATE`` to indicate the GASNet conduit that
they wish to use. Conduits are alternative implementations of the GASNet
library. GASNet uses different conduits to support different networks.
Novice users can leave this unset and Chapel will make a choice for them.

Most settings for ``CHPL_COMM_SUBSTRATE`` rely on the particular network
hardware. The options include:

ibv
    OpenIB/OpenFabrics Verbs for InfiniBand
    (see :ref:`Using Chapel with InfiniBand <readme-infiniband>`)
udp
    UDP - portable conduit, works on any network with a TCP/IP stack
    (see :ref:`Using the Portable UDP Conduit <using-udp>`)
aries
    Aries for Cray XC series
    (see :ref:`Using Chapel on Cray Systems <readme-cray>`)
mpi
    MPI - portable conduit, works on any network with MPI 1.1 or newer
    (see :ref:`readme-gasnet-mpi`)
smp
    Simulates multiple locales on a single shared-memory machine
    (see :ref:)
ofi
    OpenFabrics Interface (libfabric) for Slingshot and Omni-Path.
    (see :ref:)

See the `GASNet website <https://gasnet.lbl.gov/>`_ for more
information on each of these conduits.

Current defaults are:

====================  ===================
CHPL_TARGET_PLATFORM  CHPL_COMM_SUBSTRATE
====================  ===================
cray-cs                ibv
cray-xc                aries
pwr6                   ibv
other                  udp
====================  ===================

.. _set-comm-segment:

Setting CHPL_GASNET_SEGMENT
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++

Users can set ``CHPL_GASNET_SEGMENT`` to choose a memory segment to use
with GASNet. A GASNet segment is a region of memory that is expected to
be used for remote memory access. The GASNet library works to make memory
in this segment available for accelerated memory access supported
directly by network hardware.  The options are:

everything
  All memory is available for remote memory access.
  This option is not supported with the ``smp`` or ``ucx`` substrates.
fast
  A limited portion of memory is available and optimized for fastest remote
  memory access
large
  As with fast, but a larger amount of memory is available for communication

Each choice of segment has different tradeoffs. For the ``fast`` segment,
the Chapel heap is entirely in memory that can be directly accessed over
the network, but the drawback is that the size of the heap must be
specified at program start-up. For ``everything``, accessing memory over
the network is generally slower, but there is no need to worry about the
size of the heap or whether some memory is registered with the network.
The ``large`` segment offers a compromise between these two options,
where some portion of the heap will be available for faster network
access.

Current defaults are:

===================  ====================
CHPL_COMM_SUBSTRATE  CHPL_GASNET_SEGMENT
===================  ====================
aries                fast
ibv                  large
smp                  fast
other                everything
===================  ====================

Emulating Multilocale Execution

TODO: GASNNet+mpi

When using ``CHPL_COMM=gasnet`` with ``CHPL_COMM_SUBSTRATE=mpi``,
  .. code-block:: bash

     export GASNET_NODEFILE="$(pwd)"/nodes
     export MPIRUN_CMD='mpirun -np %N -machinefile %H %C'

.. _readme-gasnet-troubleshooting:

Troubleshooting
***************

For ``CHPL_COMM=gasnet`` runs, you may also want to consider setting
one or both of:

  .. code-block:: bash

    export GASNET_SPAWN_VERBOSE=1
    export GASNET_VERBOSEENV=1

where the first prints more information about GASNet's job launch
actions, and the second is used to audit environment variable
settings.

When running ``CHPL_COMM=gasnet`` programs using the ``udp`` conduit,
we've had best results with console I/O using:

  .. code-block:: bash

    export GASNET_ROUTE_OUTPUT=0
